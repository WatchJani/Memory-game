                        Memory game, also known as concentration, is a classic game that requires players to match pairs
                        of
                        cards
                        with the same picture or symbol. Here are the basic steps to play the game:

            </p>
            <p>
                Set up the game: Shuffle the cards and lay them face-down in a grid pattern on a flat surface. The
                number of cards can vary depending on the difficulty level you want to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take turns flipping over two cards: Each player takes a turn flipping over two cards. If the two cards
                match, the player keeps them and goes again. If the cards do not match, the player must turn them back
                over and it becomes the next player's turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember the cards: As you flip over cards, try to remember where each card is located so that you can
                match them up later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continue playing until all pairs have been matched: Players continue taking turns until all pairs have
                been matched. The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optional rule variations: You can add extra challenges to the game by limiting the number of flips per
                turn or by setting a time limit to complete the game.
            </p>
            <p>
